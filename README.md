# ðŸ“§ PhishScope â€“ AI-Powered Email Phishing Detection

> **End-to-end phishing email detection pipeline** combining **NLP, Machine Learning, and Business Intelligence** for real-world cyber defense.  
> Includes **cross-domain evaluation**, an **interactive Streamlit app**, and an **optional Power BI dashboard** for analytics.

## ðŸš€ Why This Project Matters
Phishing is one of the **top cybersecurity threats worldwide**, costing businesses over **$10.1 billion in 2022** (FBI IC3 Report).  
Most ML models detect phishing well on their training data but **fail in the real world** when new attack patterns emerge.

**PhishScope** solves this by:
- Using **historical** and **synthetic modern phishing emails**.
- Performing **cross-domain evaluation** to measure real-world generalization.
- Providing **interactive tools** for analysts and decision-makers.

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance

### **Cross-Domain Evaluation**
| Train Dataset   | Test Dataset    | Accuracy | Precision (Phish) | Recall (Phish) | ROC-AUC |
|-----------------|----------------|----------|-------------------|----------------|---------|
| Kaggle          | Synthetic      | 63%      | 0.59              | 0.94           | 0.877   |
| Synthetic       | Kaggle         | 61%      | 0.91              | 0.00           | 0.605   |

**Insight:**  
- Good performance within known domain.  
- Significant drop in reverse test â†’ highlights **concept drift** and the need for continuous retraining.

## ðŸ–¥ Streamlit App
Upload a CSV of emails with `subject` and `body` columns â†’ get:
- **Phishing probability** for each email.
- **Binary prediction** (Phish / Legit).
- **Top suspicious emails**.
- Downloadable prediction CSV.
